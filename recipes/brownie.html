    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These easy cherry brownies are perfect for those times when you get a craving for chocolaty, fudge-y brownies,
        and you want them quick and easy. There are some fabulous brownie mixes out there, and when you add fresh
        cherries and nuts, youâ€™re in for a special treat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water </li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon almond extract (optional)</li>
        <li>1 package brownie mix</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh dark sweet cherries, pitted and quartered</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped and toasted pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 165 degrees C. Line an 8x8-inch pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on two
            sides for easy removal, and spray with cooking spray. </li>
        <li>Combine oil, water, egg, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Stir in brownie mix until well combined.
            Gently fold in cherries and pecan nuts. Spread out batter evenly in the prepared pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the edges start
            to pull away from the sides of the pan, 44 to 48 minutes. </li>
        <li>Cool completely in the pan. Lift out of the pan using the parchment paper, cut, and serve. </li>
    </ol>
